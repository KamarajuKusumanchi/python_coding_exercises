To run the tests

conda activate py38
cd $repo_dir/src/leetcode/868_binary_gap
python -m pytest

Note:- Currently, I just copied code and tests file from https://github.com/kyhau/small-coding-exercises
to get the basic structure. But the code solves a different problem (counting number of zeros). We want
something else (distance between two adjacent binary 1's). Afterwards, modify the code accordingly.
